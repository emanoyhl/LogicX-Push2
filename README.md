# LogicX-Push2 - Logic Pro X Adaption (WIP)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```



This is a updated fork of pysha by ffont.   I am currently cherry picking updates from his new project and slowly adding functionality that would be useful and beneficial to Mac users with Logic Pro X.

currently because of the nature of Logic Pro and the limited OSC support I have to use OSCulator as a gateway between the push2 and logic.
